## Introduction

This repository is part of a Node.js checkpoint where various tasks are completed to demonstrate fundamental Node.js concepts. Each task has its own file, and this README provides an overview of the tasks and instructions for installation and usage.


## Tasks

### Task 1: hello-world.js

Create a file named `hello-world.js` and print "HELLO WORLD" to the console.


### Task 2: server.js

Create a server that runs on port 3000 and responds with `<h1>Hello Node!!!!</h1>` when accessed.


### Task 3: file-operations.js

Create a file named "welcome.txt" with the content "Hello Node". Read and log the data from the file.


### Task 4: password-generator.js

Create a file named "password-generator.js" and use the `generate-password` package to generate and log a random password.


### Task 5: email-sender.js

Create a file named "email-sender.js" and use the `nodemailer` package to send a test email.


## Installation

Before running the files, ensure Node.js is installed. Additionally, install the required packages for specific tasks:
```bash

npm install generate-password nodemailer


Usage

Each task has its own file. Run each file separately to test the functionality.

Example:

node hello-world.js
node server.js
# ... and so on


Notes

Make sure to delete personal information before uploading to GitHub.

Customize email-sender.js with your Gmail credentials.
